# Getting Started

The [Turso CLI] is the main interface to work with Turso databases. You can use
it to create, destroy, replicate, and query a database.

The following are requirements to get started with Turso using the CLI:

- macOS, Linux, or WSL
- A GitHub account
- Familiarity with a unix style command shell (e.g. bash)

Turso requires that you log in using a GitHub account. Any databases you create
while logged in effectively belong to that account.

Follow along with the commands shown in this tutorial to learn about how the
Turso CLI works.
